# Chess Game (In Progress)
**This is a chess game built using React and Tailwind CSS, with no external chess libraries.**

## Getting Started ##

To run the game locally, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then, install the dependencies by running:

`npm install`

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server by running:

`npm start`

This will open the game in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000/.

## How to Play ##
The game can be played by two players on the same computer. To move a piece, click on the piece you want to move and then click on the square you want to move it to. If the move is valid, the piece will move to the new square. If the move is not valid, the piece will stay in its current position.
